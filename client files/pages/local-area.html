              <p>The local village Coux-et-Bigaroque is around a kilometre from the Chateau. It is tiny and very quaint but has everything(?!) you will need during your time in France...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Le Chambellan - for rooms and some great food.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Caves de Coux - just in case you haven't drunk enough over the four days with us, or if you would like some help choosing some wine to take back with you.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>La boulangerie - because all you need is bread and cheese!</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Le tabac - does what it says on the tin!</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Church - very pretty.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>A market - if you're there on the right day - we'll double-check nearer the time.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>A beach(!) - on the river, a ten minute walk from the village.</li>

            <h3>Siorac-en-Perigord</h3>
            <p>Just across the river from the Chateau, Siorac is a small village with not quite as much charm as Le Coux, but more eating options and a supermarket!! One restaurant in particular that receives rave reviews on Trip advisor is Le Trèfle À Quatre Feuilles, although we haven't yet had a chance to visit.</p>

            <h3>St Cyprien</h3>
            <p>A 10 minute drive from the Chateau, St Cyprien is a pretty place with a few restaurants and some pretty views (as well as a supermarket!).</p>

            <h3>Beynac-et-Cazenac</h3>
            <p>Don't be fooled by the name of the village - Beynac is a 15 minute drive from the Chateau! Beynac is bigger than Coux-et-Bigaroque and has been named France's prettiest village many times. There are a few restaurants here (we like La Petite Tonnelle).</p>

            <h3>Bèlves</h3>
            <p>Bèlves is a lovely medieval town (15 minutes away in the car) with some quaint shops and a fair few options for food (including many ice cream and crêpe places!).</p>

            <h3>Cadouin</h3>
            <p>This is a picturesque village to wander around, have a drink or some food. It has an important Abbey that you can explore (which Jim likes) and a beautiful market square (which is Heather's favourite part!). Well worth a visit!</p>

            <h3>Sarlat-la-Caneda</h3>
            <p>Sarlat is probably the region's most famous town and is busy and touristy because of this. Despite the throngs of tourists here it is easy to see why people keep coming back - it's beautiful if a little crowded! Plenty of restaurants, cafés and tat shops to keep children (and adults!) entertained.</p>

            <h3>Lalinde</h3>
            <p>Lalinde is roughly halfway between Bergerac and Coux. A lovely small town with a pretty square and a couple of restaurants, we stopped for lunch on our way from the airport and then again on our return journey when a brilliant market was being held (Thursday morning this year, it probably won't change).</p>

            <h3>Le Chambellan</h3>
            <p>The only restaurant in the village is thankfully lovely! Open for dinner only, it's a good idea to book ahead if you fancy a meal here.</p>

            <h3>L'Escale</h3>
            <p>Situated on the river, L'Escale serves simple food at a reasonable price. Perfect for a pizza or salad at lunchtime, probably no need to book ahead.</p>

            <h3>L'Esperance</h3>
            <p>Located in Buisson this restaurant comes highly recommended.</p>

            <h3>La Petite Tonnelle</h3>
            <p>This great restaurant is located in Beynac but we think it's worth the trip out and the reviews on Trip Advisor speak for themselves!</p>

            <h3>Le Trèfle À Quatre Feuilles</h3>
            <p>In Siorac, Le Trèfle À Quatre Feuilles receives consistently good reviews. We haven't yet had chance to visit but hope to before the wedding.</p>

                <h3>Beaches</h3>
                <p>There are some lovely river beaches around and we're lucky that two of them are really near to the Chateau. The nearest and probably nicest is a 10 minute walk from Le Chambellan in the village, and there is another just next to L'Escale underneath the bridge to Siorac.</p>
